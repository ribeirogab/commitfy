## Configuration

### Configuration Files

`commitfy` uses configuration files located in the `~/.commitfy` directory to manage its settings and behavior:

- **`.env`**: This file contains all the necessary configurations for the app, such as API keys and other environment variables. You can edit this file to update your settings as needed.
  
- **`.commitfyignore`**: This file functions similarly to a `.gitignore` file. It is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored when generating commit messages. By customizing this file, you can control which changes are considered when `commitfy` creates a commit message.

## AI Providers

`commitfy` supports the following AI providers for generating commit messages:

- **OpenAI**

> **Note:** Currently, we only support OpenAI, but we plan to add more providers in the future. If you have a suggestion for an AI provider, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ribeirogab/commitfy/issues).
